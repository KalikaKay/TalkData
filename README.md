# Let's Talk Data!
*Final Thinkful Capstone*
*by Kalika Kay Curry*


Marketing. Is. Tough.

Identifying a viable demographic - is no small feat.

Introducing, TalkData!

This project is to construct a product as a working machine learning model that can be used to predict the demographic of the individuals who have participated in this device plan. The plan provides the users' location coordinates, time they accessed the app, phone brand, phone model, applications that they're using, the category those applications belong to, and indicates whether or not the applications are in use.

I will be using machine learning techniques to uncover the users' demographic group - consisting of a label that references their gender and age. This is a product that could be used, for example, by a telecommunications provider to identify their 小米 demographic and tailor the advertisements as such.

the data is available on Kaggle at the link above. It has been processed in a separate file.
