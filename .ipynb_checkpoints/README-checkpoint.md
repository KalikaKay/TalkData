Marketing. Is. Tough.

Identifying a viable demographic - is no small feat.

Introducing, TalkData!

This project is to construct a product as a working machine learning model that can be used to predict the demographic of the individuals who have participated in this device plan. The plan provides the users' location coordinates, time they accessed the app, phone brand, phone model, applications that they're using, the category those applications belong to, and indicates whether or not the applications are in use.


# Goal 

Use machine learning methodologies to uncover users' deomographics, such as age and/or gender, using machine learning language. This tool can be used by application owners to identify marketing strategies such as which models to partner with to tackle their demographic.
